If your system might have P = NP,
then with Facts, your system can make it P Â¬= NP.
True story.

It's this very thin extra layer of data indexing you
dream of when reading Prolog or PAIP.

Simply put, it allows you to collaborate efficiently by
giving the ability to clearly describe anything coherently
for any two live streams.

For peaceful purposes Facts is the complement to cryptography :
cryptography wants to secure and authenticate endpoints
by creating unreversable distance around them (height),
but even with cryptography and authentication and trust of others
you also need to trust they can understand the data they process.
To ensure data can be understood it has to be layout in triples,
to access rapidly and logically these triples you have Facts.

This should not be expensive.
Rather it should be stocked for judiciary purposes,
public and private, animal and human, biological and mechanical.

By means of very simple and regular indexing
the "clear description" possibility is made infinitely
extensible and can be used to scale readily in any direction,
even in the logical direction.

This logical scale can seem a bit odd at first, but good understanding
of Eulerian mathematics is the key truly. It would make your software
much harder to make blind or off topic if you manage to use it wisely.
This is not artificial intelligence, in terms of data layout it
is intelligence itself, made cooperative for two live streams
sharing time. It should lead to interesting discussions.
