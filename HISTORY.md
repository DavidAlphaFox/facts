2017

So we are back to 32 bits. Every 64b arches I tried die, which is very painful,
and hurtful.

I wrote facts in the 2010's on a Thinkpad T61 and T410 under OpenBSD.
The poor laptop died in a terrible screen incident which almost killed everyone
I know. It would seem that consciousness is not far from what this software
serves.

Looking back it has been a terrible 5 years on now.
What should be scary is that I really had a great time loosing two girlfriends,
almost all my friends and family.

Please keep the clouds off.. =)
